# From Idea to Website

![Wiki Mockup](MockupWiki.png)

## Design

<!--10-15 minutes -->

One of the best ways to sharpen your CSS skills is to try to create a page from an early-stage design called a "mockup".  With a partner, design a simple page that you've always wanted to see.  

### Design Requirements

- Your design should contain at least 4 objects
- Your design should include at least one button, one text block, and one image
- You must share your design on Slack

## Make It Real!
<!-- 45 minutes -->
Now the task is to turn this design into a real website with HTML and CSS.  There will be no starter code, only the code you write.

Don't worry if you can't get it to look _exactly_ as you designed it but try your best to get as close as possible.

### Code Requirements

- You must use display, clear, and floats to position elements on the page
- You must look up and use at least two CSS properties or values that may not have been covered in class, for example:
  - `background: url("YOUR-LINK.COM")`
  - `list-style`
  - `text-decoration`
  - `text-transform`
- You must use a single external CSS stylesheet to style all pages
- You must use the images provided or others downloaded from the Internet to construct elements on the page
- You must share a screenshot of your final product on Slack

**Bonus:**
- Throw in some animations, experiment with `hover`, make it fun.

### Self Evaluation
<!-- 5 minutes -->
During the previous exercise, rate your progress on a scale of 1-5 (5 being the highest) for the following criteria:

- **Persistence:** Do you handle frustration well? Do you independently pursue understanding?
- **Organization:** Do you thoughtfully implement best coding patterns and practices?
- **Collaboration:** Do you make an effort to solve problems and share your ideas with others?
- **Communication:** Do you clearly convey your thoughts to others in illustrative and clear ways?
- **Self-compassion:** Do you make productive use of turning failures into learning opportunities?
- **Resourcefulness:** Do make an effort to compare and contrast new ideas with ones you already know?
